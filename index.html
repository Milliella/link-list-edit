            <h4>Traditional Artists:</h4>
            <p> As a painter many of my favourite artists use traditional mediums such as paint and pencil, one of my biggest inspirations from an early age has been the artist, Francis Bacon. He’s an untrained oil painter whose work is very dark and eerie, I especially like the work he produced between the 40s and 50s, they feel raw and unnerving and that’s a feeling I've always been interested in exploring within my own work. The work of Jean-Michel Basquiat has also been a big influence on my mark making and colour choices, as well as the paintings of Maggi Hambling. One of my biggest influences has also been the Polish artist Zdzislaw Beksinski, who creates nightmarish depictions of a post-apocalyptic world. I love his style and the colours he uses in his pieces.

            <h4>Ai Artists</h4>
            <p>Within the world of creative Ai and coding I have come across a large number of artists and programmers who are wildly interesting and inspiring to me. One large example is the artist Sofia Crespo who works with Biology-inspired Technologies to create her work, one of my favourite projects of hers is a collection of videos called “Critically Extinct” that showcase generated images of endangered species. Other artists of interest include Douggy Pledger who creates grotesque Ai generated portraits and artwork, the fashion designer Iris Van Herpen who utilises technologies like 3D printing and robotics to create alien like garments. And finally, the Ai experiment “Lobe” who is described as a “demon woman” that shows up a lot in generated images, she was discovered by an artist while using a text-to-image Ai model. All the images using “Lobe” as the starting point were found to always include the same woman and were becoming increasingly gory with every new generation.
